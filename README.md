# Lovetone-Brownsource

This is a kicad pcb layout for the Lovetone Brownsource guitar pedal. The original schematic can be found here: http://bmamps.com/Schematics/Effects_miscellaneous/Lovetone_BrownSource.gif.

A description for the pedal can be found here:http://www.lovetone.com/bsource.html.

I've modified the schematic to use a 10uF film cap for C2 and to include footprints for a 3PDT footswitch with and LED indicator. A Bill of Materials will be added soon. 

You can see a copy of the PCB on OSHpark here:https://oshpark.com/profiles/BigBird42.
